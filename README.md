# üñ•Ô∏è Areas of Interest
I am a current 3rd year undergraduate student studying MEng Electronics and Computer Engineering (Hons) at the University of Nottingham. This GitHub contains projects related to software development.

# üß† Programming Skills
I can develop software in C, C++, Python, Java, Assembly

# üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on
* AUTOMATED MONITORING SYSTEM FOR SLALOM KAYAK - Automated gate detection system for paddlers, incorporating novel sensor-based solution considering environmental factors including noise, complemented by a BMS system. Implemented communication platform via MQTT on Raspberry Pi and GUI using MATLAB App Designer.

# üí° What I Have Worked On

*	VIRTUAL REALITY SYSTEM FOR VISUALISING COMPLEX ENGINEERING CAD MODELS‚Äì Creating an interactive GUI using Qt Creator which loads and renders STL files in virtual reality. Designed to be used for UoN racing team models to take models apart using VR controllers. Programmed in C++
*	DOPPLER RADAR BASED SPEED DETECTOR SYSTEM ‚Äì Developed a speed detection system using comparator and ADC methods, designed amplifier and filter circuits, programmed using STM32 IDE and Xilinx ISE for CPLD logic.
*	AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE - Created an SAE Level 4 autonomous vehicle with a reverse parking system using sensors. It employs optical line following with PID control, V2X communication via Raspberry Pi and MQTT with Node-RED, and computer vision with OpenCV. Programmed in C. 
*	RSA ENCRYPTION - Using MATLAB, created a graphical user interface to create generate public and private keys, encryption, and decryption as an implementation of the RSA algorithm. 
*	HYBRID ECC-AES MODEL ‚Äì A hybrid encryption and decryption model which generates secure keys using elliptic curve cryptography to be used for AES encryption and decryption of text using MATLAB.
